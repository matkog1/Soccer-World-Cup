# **World Cup Statistics Display Project**


## **Overview**

This project aims to display statistics from the 2018 Men's World Cup and 2019 Women's World Cup using the provided API: [https://worldcup-vua.nullbit.hr/](https://worldcup-vua.nullbit.hr/). The project consists of three applications - a Windows Forms application, a Windows Presentation Foundation application, and a Class Library for data manipulation.

## **Data Layer**

The Class Library is responsible for data manipulation, including retrieving data from the API, parsing and mapping data, preparing data for use in client applications, and storing data in text files. The API endpoints are explained, including endpoints for retrieving data about national teams and matches, and the use of JSON files for data retrieval is also discussed.

## **Windows Forms Application**

The Windows Forms application displays favorite national teams and players, creates ranking lists, and allows users to change application settings and confirm when closing the application. Exception handling and relative paths for resources are also implemented.

## **Windows Presentation Foundation Application**

The Windows Presentation Foundation application provides an overview of national teams, displays starting lineups, and allows users to view player overviews. It also allows users to change application settings and confirm when closing the application. Exception handling and relative paths for resources are also implemented.

## **Recommendations**

Recommendations for tools to use when consuming the API and retrieving data include Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome with the JSONView extension, and Postman. Examples of different ways to consume a RESTful API in C# are also provided.
